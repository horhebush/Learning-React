# Learning React

This repository is part of my personal learning journey with **React**.  
I'm exploring how to build React applications using:

- âš¡ **Vite** â€” for fast development and bundling
- ðŸ”· **TypeScript** â€” for type safety and better developer experience
- âœ… **ESLint** â€” to maintain clean and consistent code

---

## What I'm Doing

- Learning the basics of React components, props, state, and hooks.
- Understanding how TypeScript integrates with React for better type checking.
- Using Vite to quickly spin up and build React projects.
- Experimenting with ESLint configurations to improve code quality.
- Setting up a solid development environment for future React projects.

## Why This Repo Exists

This is not a complete project or production app â€” itâ€™s a **learning sandbox** where I can:

- Practice new concepts
- Test out configurations
- Build small experiments and exercises
